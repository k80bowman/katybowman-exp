excerpt: "I have to say, I was proud of my son when we took him to see The Hobbit a couple of months ago. “That wasn’t in the book,” he said several times during the movie. My husband had read him the book a few months before, and he is only five, so the fact that he remembered so much detail was impressive. I don’t know that I could remember that much detail about what happened to me the day before, let alone what happened in a book I read six months ago. Clearly, it had made an impression."
