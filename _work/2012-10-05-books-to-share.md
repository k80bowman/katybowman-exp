excerpt: "Before I had even met my husband, I was buying books for our kids. Our future kids, I should say—they wouldn’t be born for another eight years. But I was twenty, working in a bookstore, and there they were, treasures from my childhood. Aw heck, who am I kidding? I bought them for myself."
