excerpt: "Kate DiCamillo, Alison McGhee, and Tony Fucile have created two characters that from the first page of Bink and Gollie secured a place in my heart. The two books (so far, I am hoping for more)—Bink and Gollie and Bink And Gollie, Two for One–celebrate the friendship of these two girls and send them off on adventures: roller skating, having a “compromise bonanza,” taking a goldfish to the movies, an unfortunate encounter with the whack-a-duck man at the state fair, and finding their destiny, among others."
