excerpt: "I don’t know about you all, but I usually have at least three books going at one time, if not more. It makes for a pretty frenetic reading schedule, but there are so many books out there I can’t wait to start reading, and so I don’t. However, sometimes I just want to be immersed in the story and be able to experience it from beginning to end in a couple of hours. This is what makes book-to-movie adaptations so great."
