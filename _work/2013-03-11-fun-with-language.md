excerpt: "In the last few months, my daughter has become enthralled by the stories of Beatrix Potter. Just writing that sentence makes me happy. I loved Potter’s stories when I was younger. My favorite was always The Tale of Benjamin Bunny. The funny thing is, I can’t remember why. I think maybe because he got into trouble. Which makes me laugh, because it is the exact same reason my daughter has fallen in love with the books, too."
