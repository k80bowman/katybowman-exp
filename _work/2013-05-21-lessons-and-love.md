excerpt: "Ms. Short’s book is full of hard-won lessons. “The biggest turns in life come when you’re paying the least attention,” MayJune, a character in the novel, tells Donna, “making small choices you don’t yet know will change everything.” And, indeed, this novel is very much about the choices we make in our lives and how we must work hard to make sure those choices move us closer to our dreams."
