excerpt: "When I was a kid, we took a lot of road trips. That meant spending several hours in a car—sometimes the entire day—which added up to a lot of boredom. Especially for me, since I get motion sickness and basically can’t do much while a car is moving except look out the window. Reading was definitely out of the question."
