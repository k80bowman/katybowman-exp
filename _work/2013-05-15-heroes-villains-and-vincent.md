excerpt: "Heroes, Villains, and Vincent, written by Trenton Payne and illustrated by Shahab Shamshirsaz, is a picture book about the decision everyone has to make sooner or later about the kind of person they want to be. Poor Vincent, he has it harder than most. He loves having two families, but each one wants him to be something completely different. Super hero or super villain? How is a boy to choose?"
