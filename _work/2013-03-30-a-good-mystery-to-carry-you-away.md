excerpt: "A few years back I picked up the first book in Jacqueline Winspearâ€™s Maisie Dobbs mystery series because I liked the picture on the cover. I needed a book that would carry me away and it looked like it would do the trick. A simple image of a woman from the 1920s in a cloche hat? Perfect. And I was not disappointed."
