excerpt: "Rise of the Guardians is based on the Guardians of Childhood series of books by William Joyce. In the movie and the books Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and other familiar childhood icons become guardians of the children of Earth, bringing them joy and protecting them from Pitch, the nightmare king. The movie tells the story of Jack Frost and his transformation from a mischievous spirit into a guardian and, in the process, finding his centerâ€“the meaning of his life."
